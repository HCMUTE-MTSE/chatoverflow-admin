## Project structure

There are two subfolders in the project:

`/client`: nextjs client
`/api`: nestjs api

### Client

Client are setup using NextJS App Router.

Originally, it is a fullstack Nextjs Project so you can see i fetched data directly from client, i keep this behavior because we can see the actuall UI.

Latter in this project, we will replace the data fetching with NestJS API.

### API

API are setup using NestJS.
